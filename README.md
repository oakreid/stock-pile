Our web application is deployed on the public web so no need to set it up or build it locally! You can find it at https://stockpile.oakreid.info/ .

Please contact Oakley at reid.o@husky.neu.edu if there are any issues with our project appearing on the site. If the site does not appear it is probably because Oakley is broke and he ran out of money on the Vultr account that he used to obtain the VPS hosting the website and didnâ€™t realize it.

The project database is hosted on the same VPS as the webapp and able to be accessed remotely. Use the following credentials to access it if need be:
    Username: [SEE FINAL PROJECT REPORT]
    Password: [SEE FINAL PROJECT REPORT]
    Hostname: [SEE FINAL PROJECT REPORT]
    Port: [SEE FINAL PROJECT REPORT]
    Default Schema: [SEE FINAL PROJECT REPORT]
